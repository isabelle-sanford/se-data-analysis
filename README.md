Analysis of Sanderson Elimination statistics 


TO DO:
- Change paths for all analysis outputs to account for moving them into Cleaning

- Implement other filters
    - Checkboxes instead of dropdowns? 
- Add table at bottom
- Tabs? 
- include number of games you're viewing somewhere - probably in header above dropdowns

- Bar plot: # surviving players vs game; color indicates what amount of each alignment was left alive
- Fiddle with outcome/elim % dot plot
- Maybe initial bar plot is scatter & by outcome instead? Survival/death distracts a lot from the point
    - Consider lines of best fit
- Bubble plot: outcomes vs length
- Modified sunburst diagram - pie chart that you can click to see the extent of one piece broken down
- Maybe whole inactivity tab? 

Tab options: Outcomes, Broken, Inactivity, format? 

filters: format, broken, mod, gm, winner, complexity, setting, length
non-filters: game, # of players, alignments, outcomes, inactives, winner, length


Data collection stuff
- Lot of Broken isn't filled in
- scrape start and end dates from 17S
- eventually also scrape votes, quicklinks, etc
